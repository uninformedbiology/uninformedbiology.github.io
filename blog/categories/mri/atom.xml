    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Installing computers and magnets within one&rsquo;s own body is occuring today for reasons other than critical medical concerns. One man placed magnets in his ear so he can have embeded headphones into his head (<a href="http://discuss.biohack.me/discussion/379/implanted-earphones/p1">biohack.me</a>.) Another man implanted a smartphone size device into his arm to do things like monitor his vital signs (<a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/01/this-guy-implanted-a-giant-computer-chip-into-his-arm-without-medical-supervision/">time.com</a>.)</p>

<p>I would propose a simple issue with implanting devices like this into your body. What if you need an MRI? Magnetic Resonance Imaging uses extremely powerful magnets (0.5 to 7 Tesla) to essentially line up every hydrogen ion in your body to make detailed images of a region inside your body. If you have a bunch of metal in your body you can&rsquo;t get an MRI without ripping out the implants. To me this is a deal breaker; no implants for me.</p>
