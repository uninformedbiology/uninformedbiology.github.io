  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title of this blog post is actually the title of the chapter I just finished in my biology text book (<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/Campbell-Biology-9th-Edition-Jane-Reece/11395612429/bd?cm_mmc=gmc-_-gmc-_-PLA-_-v01">Campbell</a> 2009). This post is mostly for helping my own recollection.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>sex linked gene</em> &mdash; A gene located on a sex chromosome</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bar body</em> &mdash; Human females (other species also have Bar bodies) inherit two copies of the X sex chromosome. During embryo development one of these X chromosomes becomes compact and shrinks in size effectively leaving a female with one functioning X chromosome. Which of the two X chromosomes becomes a Bar body seems to be random.</p></li>
<li><p><em>linked genes</em> &mdash; Genes that are &ldquo;close&rdquo; to each other on a chromosome (not sure how close is close enough)</p></li>
<li><p><em>recombinant types</em> &mdash; When inspecting two or more characters in a test cross, an \(F_{1}\) offspring can either express a phenotype similar to or different than its parents. When offspring express a phenotype that isn&rsquo;t like one of its parent&rsquo;s, that offspring is called a recombinant type.</p></li>
<li><p><em>genetic recombination</em> &mdash; the production of offspring with traits that differ from those found in either parent</p></li>
<li><p><em>genetic map</em> &mdash; An ordered list of genes on a specific chromosome where order is defined by the loci of genes compared to other genes</p></li>
<li><p><em>linkage map</em> &mdash; A genetic map based on recombination frequencies</p></li>
<li><p><em>map unit</em> &mdash; The distance between two genes on a genetic map</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Linkage maps</h2>

<p>Alleles on the same chromosome are observed to be passed to offspring together. (See my <a href="/blog/2013/12/21/reproductive-entropy/">previous post</a> to see what I think the consequences of this are.) For example, if a parent heterozygous dominant for two linked genes (same chromosome) is crossed (this is a dihybrid cross) with a parent who is homozygous recessive for both genes, then offspring will either be heterozygous dominant or homozygous recessive since those are the only two types of combinations found on the chromosomes passed down by its parents. Every so often though, crossing over occurs
and the offspring doesn&rsquo;t inherit a gene combination that either of the parents had; this offspring is a <em>recombinant type</em>.</p>

<p>Linkage maps use the frequency at which a <em>recombinant type</em> appears as a way to measure distance. If crossing over points happen randomly along a chromosome then genes that are <em>closer</em> together have a <em>smaller</em> chance of causing recombination. Like wise, the <em>further</em> two genes are from each other the more likely it is that crossing over would occur between the two genes and cause a recombinant offspring.</p>

<p>By ordering all genes while trying to minimize the frequency between any two genes you piece together a linkage map.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>cytogenic maps</em> &mdash; Maps that mark genes based on chromosomal features like stained bands</p></li>
<li><p><em>aneuploidy</em>  &mdash; When a cell does not have a chromosome count that is also a multiple of the organism&rsquo;s haploid number</p></li>
<li><p><em>monosomic</em>  &mdash; When a zygote is missing a chromosome (it has 2n &ndash; 1). The zygote is <em>monosomic</em> for its missing chromosome.</p></li>
<li><p><em>trisomic</em>  &mdash; When a zygote has an extra chromosome (it as 2n + 2). The zygote is <em>trisomic</em> for its extra chromosome type.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>A Question</h2>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t two women have a baby girl? A zygote formed by two female eggs would receive 23 chromosomes from mom and another 23 chromosomes from other mom, would this work? I asked this question to myself some weeks ago and didn&rsquo;t know the answer until I read about <em>genomic imprinting</em>. During gamete formation certain genes are methylated (\(&mdash;CH_{3}\) groups attach to cytosine nucleotides). Genes that are methylated stay wrapped with up with their histones in a condensed form and do not code for
mRNA (or proteins). Genomic imprinting affects genes on a per sex basis; i.e. genomic imprinting of a certain gene only happens in certain sexes.</p>

<p>Genomic imprinting can explain why two females, while having the right <em>amount</em> of DNA, couldn&rsquo;t possibly form a functioning offspring: certain genes are not active in female sex cells and zygotes rely on the male version of the allele for gene expression.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Installing computers and magnets within one&rsquo;s own body is occuring today for reasons other than critical medical concerns. One man placed magnets in his ear so he can have embeded headphones into his head (<a href="http://discuss.biohack.me/discussion/379/implanted-earphones/p1">biohack.me</a>.) Another man implanted a smartphone size device into his arm to do things like monitor his vital signs (<a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/01/this-guy-implanted-a-giant-computer-chip-into-his-arm-without-medical-supervision/">time.com</a>.)</p>

<p>I would propose a simple issue with implanting devices like this into your body. What if you need an MRI? Magnetic Resonance Imaging uses extremely powerful magnets (0.5 to 7 Tesla) to essentially line up every hydrogen ion in your body to make detailed images of a region inside your body. If you have a bunch of metal in your body you can&rsquo;t get an MRI without ripping out the implants. To me this is a deal breaker; no implants for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had some down time recently which I&rsquo;ve partly used to write a meiosis simulator and a punnet
square generator &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/uberj/mendelism">https://github.com/uberj/mendelism</a></p>

<p>This side project plus being confused about how linked genes affect the law of independent
assortment made me take the time to write this up.</p>

<p>First some definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>the law of segregation</em> &mdash; during meiosis alleles are separated and each germ cell randomly gets
one of the alleles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>the law of independent assortment</em> &mdash; during meiosis the probability of a single gene&rsquo;s allele
going to a specific germ cell is independent of other genes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>linked genes</em> &mdash; genes that are &ldquo;close&rdquo; to each other on a chromosome (not sure how close is close
enough).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The law of segregation is a result of Anaphase I. During Anaphase I a homologous pair of chromosomes (2 chromosomes, 4 chromatids) splits. One of the pair  has the first allele and the second has the second allele. Meiosis I finishes with two daughter cells containing disjoint sets of alleles (i.e. each gene   has its alleles spread across both cells).</p>

<p>The law of independent assortment can be seen as a result of Metaphase I.  During Metaphase I, right before Anaphase I, two alleles line up on either side of the Metaphase I plate. Which cell an allele joins for meiosis II depends on which side of the plate they were on &mdash; this sidedness is random.</p>

<p>So how do linked genes interact with these two laws? The law of segregation is still true because even if two alleles (who were members of different genes) were on the same chromosome, they would still split into two cells. Said another way: the product cells of meiosis I would still have disjoint sets of alleles.</p>

<p>Linked genes do interact with the law of independent assortment. If two genes are on the same chromosome then their configuration in the Metaphase I plate will always be the same.</p>

<p>Here is an experiment: Say we have four genes. All four genes are on their own chromosomes. During Metaphase I the Metaphase plate forms and the homologs   line up. For each gene there is 50/50 chance of going to either of the cells produced by Cytokinesis I. With four chromosomes this gives 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 or 2 ^ 4 or 16 different possibilities.</p>

<p>Another experiment: Say we have four genes. There are only <em>two</em> chromsomes and the genes are split evenly between the chromosomes. We can calculate the number of possible plate configurations 2 * 2 or 2 ^ 2 or 4.</p>

<p>In information theory, entropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content (<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29">Wikipedia</a></cite>).
In this way we can interpret an increase in the number of chromosomes to mean an increase in unpredictability of the genotype of the germ cells. We could call this sexual entropy or reproductive entropy.</p>
