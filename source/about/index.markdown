This blog servers as an intellectual outlet as I learn about basic biological concepts. I am by no means an expert and I am severely _uninformed_ about most topics in biology.

Without a doubt, I will post things to this blog that are half-truths and incorrect. As I become more  _informed_ I will try to correct my former self with posts about the things I learn.
